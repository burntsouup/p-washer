# Decisions

Short records of the choices that shape the project, so future-you (or Copilot) knows _why_.
Add an entry when a decision would be surprising to someone reading the code.

## 1. Babylon.js as the engine

**Why:** Free (Apache-2.0), JavaScript-first, and batteries-included: picking that returns
UV coordinates (essential for cleaning), shadows, particles, material plugins, and a built-in
Inspector. **Revisit if:** we hit a hard limitation, which is unlikely at this scale.

## 2. Plain JavaScript, not TypeScript

**Why:** No build step to learn, and Babylon ships type definitions so VS Code autocompletes
in plain JS anyway. Pure logic files use `// @ts-check` + JSDoc comments to catch type mistakes.
**Revisit if:** the codebase grows large enough that refactors keep breaking things.

## 3. No physics engine in v0.1

**Why:** Walking on a flat yard and bumping into walls works with Babylon's built-in collisions
(`moveWithCollisions`). The feet are simply pinned to the ground each frame instead of
simulating gravity, since v0.1 has no slopes, stairs, or jumping. The spray is a raycast, not
physics. **Revisit when:** we need dynamic objects or uneven ground. Then prefer Babylon's Havok
plugin (`@babylonjs/havok`, MIT) over Rapier because it integrates directly and includes a
character controller.

## 4. Dirt is a CPU-side grid in UV space

**Why:** Each cleanable surface stores one dirt value per texel in a plain array. Spray hits
give a UV coordinate; we subtract a soft brush there and upload the changed grid as a texture.
It's sharp enough, progress is exact and cheap, and the core is pure JS we can unit-test.
Alternatives considered: vertex colors (blurry, needs dense meshes) and GPU render-target
painting (faster at scale, but progress needs GPU readback and it's harder to debug).
**Details:** ~2 cm per texel (the 5 × 10 m driveway is 256 × 512). Dirt comes off linearly, so
extreme dirt (1.0) takes 4× as long as a light film (0.25). A texel counts as clean at ≤ 0.05.
Starting dirt is generated from a seed in meters, so it doesn't depend on texture resolution.
**Revisit if:** we need many large, high-resolution surfaces at once.

## 5. Import Babylon.js from the package root

**Why:** Deep imports (`@babylonjs/core/Meshes/...`) shrink the bundle but can silently drop
features unless you add the right side-effect imports, which is a confusing trap early on.
Cost: the build is ~6.7 MB minified (~1.5 MB gzipped). **Revisit:** before a public release.

## 6. Babylon Inspector as a dev-only dependency

**Why:** The Inspector (click a mesh, tweak a light, view a texture) is one of the best ways to
learn and debug Babylon scenes; we'll use it to look at the dirt texture in Milestone 6. It's
loaded with a dynamic `import()` only when `import.meta.env.DEV` is true, so production builds
don't include it. The CDN version doesn't work with npm-installed Babylon.
**Cost:** ~600 MB in `node_modules` (mostly an icon package), on dev machines and CI only.
**Revisit if:** installs or CI get noticeably slow.

## 7. Roadmap file instead of GitHub Issues

**Why:** Solo project. A checklist in `docs/ROADMAP.md` is simpler, versioned with the code,
and readable by Copilot. **Revisit if:** collaborators or public bug reports show up.

## 8. GitHub Pages for playtest builds, relative base path

**Why:** Free, and every merge to `main` deploys a playable URL automatically. `base: './'`
in `vite.config.js` makes the same build work on Pages and on itch.io (for a later release).
Load files from `public/` with `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` + path, never a leading `/`.

## 9. HTML/CSS for the HUD

**Why:** Simpler than in-engine GUI, familiar, and inspectable with browser devtools.

## 10. Level built in code from simple shapes

**Why:** A small "greybox kit" (`src/environment/greybox.js`) builds boxes, pyramids and blobs
from a few lines each, so moving the house or resizing the driveway is a one-number change
with instant live reload. No 3D modeling tool or asset pipeline needed yet.
**Revisit when:** we want real art. Then model in Blender and load `.glb` files, keeping
the driveway (and anything cleanable) as separate meshes with clean UVs.

## 11. Dirt drawn by a material plugin

**Why:** `DirtMaterialPlugin` adds ~10 lines of shader code to Babylon's standard material,
so dirty surfaces keep normal lighting and shadows. The dirt grid is uploaded as a one-byte-
per-texel texture with mipmaps (~0.1 ms per upload). The alternative, coloring an RGBA texture
on the CPU, is simpler but can't add wetness or sharp detail later without a rewrite.
**Gotcha:** the plugin must request UVs (`_needUVs`, `MAINUV1`) because the material has no
other textures. `RawTexture.CreateRTexture` defaults to float data, so pass the byte type.
Values that change every frame (the highlight) must be set in `hardBindForSubMesh`, which
Babylon only calls if the plugin sets `registerForExtraEvents = true` before enabling.

## 12. Two-ray aiming and distance falloff

**Why:** The crosshair ray (from the camera) decides _what_ you aim at; a second ray from the
nozzle to that point is the actual water. This keeps third-person aiming intuitive while
letting walls and props block the spray realistically. With distance, the spot widens and
weakens linearly; beyond 6 m nothing happens. Because most of the driveway is a light film,
a wide, weaker spray (2–4 m) clears it fastest, while getting close gives full strength for
tire tracks, corners and oil stains. That choice is the mechanic.
**Tuning (Milestone 10):** a simulation of a player sweeping rows at 1.5 m/s showed the first
numbers needed ~7.5 min of _perfect_ play to finish. With `cleanRate: 3`, `nozzleRadius:
0.08`, `spreadPerMeter: 0.09`, one pass at 2.3 m clears ~90% and perfect play finishes in
~2.4 min (a real player: ~4–5 min), with heavy dirt still needing extra passes.

## 13. Feedback ("juice") without asset files

**Why:** Placeholder art shouldn't block feel. Wetness lives in the dirt texture's second
channel (red = dirt, green = wetness), so one upload covers both; the shader darkens wet spots
and adds a sky sheen and sun glints. Particle and beam textures are drawn with the 2D canvas
API at startup. Sounds are synthesized with the Web Audio API: filtered noise for water,
random clicks for grit, oscillators for the engine. A pure `audioMix()` decides the volume of
each layer from the washer's state, so the sound design rules are readable and tested.
**Revisit when:** we want richer sound. Swap in CC0 recordings (e.g. from Freesound) behind the
same four layers, and list them in `CREDITS.md`.
**Gotcha:** browsers block audio until the player interacts, so the audio graph is built on
the first click.

## 14. A job is done at 98%

**Why:** Hunting the last invisible specks is the least fun part of cleaning games. At 98%
(`config.job.completeAt`) the job completes and leftover dirt fades away in about a second,
which feels like a reward instead of a chore. The bar shows progress relative to that
threshold, so it reads 100% exactly at completion. Holding `F` highlights anything still
counted as dirty, for players who want to find what they missed. The timer starts at the
first spray so walking around first doesn't count. `R` only restarts after completion, so a
stray keypress can't wipe your progress.
**Progress is weighted by starting dirt (v0.2):** a spot counts for as much dirt as it started
with, once it's fully clean. Counting spots equally let players reach 98% without touching
the oil stains (only ~1% of the area); weighted, the stains are ~3% of progress and heavy
grime makes the bar jump.

## 15. Tuning panel ships with the game (behind `T`)

**Why:** Feel is found by playing, not by editing numbers and reloading. The lil-gui panel
(MIT, ~30 KB) edits `config` live; most systems already read it every frame, and the few that
copy a value at startup (camera FOV, master volume, job threshold) get an onChange hook. It's
included in production builds, hidden until `T`, so tuning works on the live site too.
"Copy changes" copies only the edited values as JSON, ready to paste into `config.js` (or
into a Copilot chat) to make them the new defaults. Nothing is saved between reloads, so
`config.js` stays the single source of truth.
