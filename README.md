# p-washer

**▶ Play the latest build: https://burntsouup.github.io/p-washer/**

A small, satisfying 3D pressure-washing game. Walk up to something dirty, blast it clean,
enjoy the before/after. Built with [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) and plain
JavaScript.

**Status:** early prototype. See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for what's done and next.

| `npm run dev`     | Dev server with live reload                              |
| `npm test`        | Run unit tests once (`npm run test:watch` to keep going) |
| `npm run lint`    | Check code for mistakes (ESLint)                         |
| `npm run format`  | Auto-format everything (Prettier)                        |
| `npm run build`   | Production build into `dist/`                            |

## Project layout

```
src/
  main.js              Entry point: creates the Game
  config.js            Every tunable number lives here
  game/                Game loop, keyboard/mouse input, shared helpers
  environment/         The level: layout (Backyard.js), lighting + sky, greybox shape kit
  player/              The player character (movement.js is the tested, pure part)
  camera/              Third-person camera (cameraMath.js is the tested, pure part)
  cleaning/            Dirt: DirtMask (grid + brush), patterns, the dirt shader, CleaningSystem
  pressure-washer/     The machine, the spray gun, aiming, and the water beam
  ui/                  HTML overlay: crosshair, prompts, "click to play", FPS
docs/
  ROADMAP.md           Milestones and checklists (our plan)
  DECISIONS.md         Why things are the way they are
```

The `audio/` folder is added by the milestone that needs it.

**Rule of thumb:** files that import Babylon.js are glue. Game logic and math go in "pure"
files (no Babylon imports) with a `*.test.js` file next to them.

## How we work

1. Branch off `main` for each roadmap step: `git switch -c m2-greybox`
2. Commit small, working steps with short imperative messages ("Add driveway mesh")
3. Push and open a pull request. CI runs lint, format check, tests, and build
4. Squash-merge when green. `main` auto-deploys to GitHub Pages in about a minute
5. Play the deployed build, write down what feels bad, repeat

`main` should always be playable.
